## Introduction

This is my first full stack project using the MERN stack!
For a while now, it has been hard to keep track of my workouts and exercises while at the gym with my friends. <br/>
Hence, this was a way for us to keep track of our workouts, while seeing what everyone else is doing to keep each other motivated!<br/>
You can add Users and each user can input their exercise with different paramters, such as duration, time, etc. All of this can be seen on the 'Exercises' page. <br/>

Here's a quick Walk Through!

## To Start 
You can download as a zip file and open in any editor like VS Code. <br />
Go to the terminal and navigate to the backend folder <br/>
Once in the folder, run <br/>
### `nodemon server`
You should get a message saying "MongoDB database connection established sucessfully" <br/>
Once that occurs, open a new terminal and type in 
### `npm start`
The project should now be up and running! Enjoy!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
