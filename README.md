This is my first full stack project using the MERN stack!

For a while now, it has been hard to keep track of my workouts while at the gym with my friends. Furthermore, I wanted a way to show everyone's workout so we could see what others did.  <br/>

Hence, this project was a way for us to keep track of our workouts, while seeing what everyone else is doing to keep each other motivated!<br/>

You can add Users and each user can input their exercise with different paramters, such as duration, time, etc. All of this can be seen on the 'Exercises' page. <br/>

Check out the walkthrough below! 

## WalkThrough
In this Walkthrough, we create a new user named Henry and logged in a running session. This session can be seen by other users in the table view!

## To Start 
You can download as a zip file and open in any editor like VS Code. <br />
Go to the terminal and navigate to the backend folder <br/>
Once in the folder, run <br/>
### `nodemon server`
You should get a message saying "MongoDB database connection established sucessfully" <br/>
Once that occurs, open a new terminal and type in 
### `npm start`
The project should now be up and running! Enjoy!
